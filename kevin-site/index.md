# Personal Philosophy

I believe in ideas that endure.
I believe technology should serve people, not enslave them.
I believe simplicity reveals truth.
I believe in building things worth remembering.

My work aims to cut through the noise, confront the unknown, and offer clarity. Always forward. Never fake.
